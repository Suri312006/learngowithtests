## Cycle for TDD (Test Driven Development)
- write a test
- make the compiler pass
- run the test, see that it fails and check the error message is meaningful
- Write enough code to make the test pass
- Refactor
- what else should be done

## general
- in go, public functions start with an Upper-case character
while lower case functions start witha lower-case character
